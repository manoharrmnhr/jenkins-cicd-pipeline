# 🚀 Task 2: Create a Simple Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD

## 🎯 Objective
Set up a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate the process of building and deploying an application.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Jenkins  
- Docker  

## 📦 Deliverables
- A `Jenkinsfile` to build and deploy the application automatically.

## 💡 Steps / Hints
a. Install Jenkins (or use a cloud instance).  
b. Create a `Jenkinsfile` in your project repo with steps to build and deploy the app.  
c. Configure Jenkins to trigger the pipeline on each code commit.  
d. Add stages like **Build**, **Test**, and **Deploy**.  
e. Test the pipeline by pushing changes and checking the Jenkins dashboard.

## 🧠 Outcome
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn how to automate application deployment using Jenkins.  
- Understand how CI/CD pipelines improve DevOps efficiency.  
- Gain hands-on experience integrating **Jenkins** with **Docker** for continuous delivery.
